## Progress Reports

### 2-2-24

This week, we began building the game in Unity. We created a preliminary build of the game which is the bare bones of what the game will turn into. Currently, the only feature it has is the display of the current word and the ability to take in keyboard input to type the word. Behind the scenes, there are also action events that recognize when a correct or incorrect key is pressed and when a word is failed or completed. These will be used to build up the other components, such as animations, taking damage, and tracking level completion. We began working on the script for the game, which is a rough draft of the opening cutscene. We have a general idea of what will happen in the cutscene right after the first level as well. We also collected some publicly available assets to use in our game, including models for the environments, some weapons, and some visual effects. Finally, we launched the GitHub repository and added some of our files as assets.
